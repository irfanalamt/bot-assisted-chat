# Intelligent Web Chat Interface

A powerful web-based chat interface that incorporates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to streamline interactions between users and both bots and live agents. The system provides real-time chat functionality and intent-based agent routing. Crafted with flexibility in mind, it can be seamlessly embedded on any client website.

The system is divided into two main components:

1. **User Chat Interface**: A lightweight, easily embeddable chat interface designed to facilitate user interaction.
2. **Agent Dashboard and Chat**: A robust, React-based frontend that provides agents with the tools necessary for user assistance.

## Features

### User Chat Interface

- **Easy Embedding**: A simple script tag is all it takes to embed the chat interface into any website.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Offers instant, real-time chat capabilities.
- **Advanced NLP**: Utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing to understand user intent and streamline interactions.
- **Bots and Live Agents**: Users can interact with both bots and live agents depending on the requirements.

### Agent Dashboard and Chat

- **React-based Interface**: Provides a modern, user-friendly dashboard built using React.
- **Intent-Based Routing**: Advanced routing system that connects users to the most suitable agent based on their intent.
- **Live Chat Support**: Enables agents to offer real-time assistance to users.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Displays useful statistics and data to help agents monitor chat activity and performance.

## Goals

1. **To offer seamless, real-time chat functionality**: Make user-agent interactions instantaneous and efficient.
2. **To integrate Advanced NLP**: Enhance the chat interface's comprehension of user input and interaction.
3. **To provide a robust agent dashboard**: Equip agents with a user-friendly interface filled with necessary tools to assist users effectively.
4. **To ensure easy embeddability**: The chat interface should be easily integrated into any client website with minimal coding.
5. **To incorporate intent-based agent routing**: Ensure users are connected to the most suitable agent based on their needs, making the system more efficient and user-friendly.
